Dev Notes
==========================================

----------------------
Reference Resolutions
----------------------
* All Reference Resolutions used should be 16:9
* Originally set Camera Reference Resolution to 160x90 and then 320x180.
* However, these resolutions looked really bad when rotating to NON axis-aligned directions (extremely pixelated)
* Once I increased the Reference Resolution to something much higher (e.g. 1280x720) then the rotated sprites looked much better.


----------------------
Ship Sprites
----------------------
* In the Ship Sprites asset, the player ships are facing upwards, while the enemy sprite assets are facing downwards.
* In Unity 2D, the "forward" vector is actually Vector2.up (Vector3.forwards is the inward Z-direction of the camera)
* When building the enemy ship sprites, add them to a child of an empty GameObject then rotate 180 degrees so they point up.

16:9 Reference Resolution Info
-------------------------------
160  x 90   =>   12 * 1920x1080
192  x 108  =>   10 * 1920x1080 
240  x 135  =>    8 * 1920x1080
320  x 180  =>    6 * 1920x1080
384  x 216  =>    5 * 1920x1080
480  x 270  =>    4 * 1920x1080
640  x 360  =>    3 * 1920x1080
960  x 540  =>    2 * 1920x1080
1280 x 720  =>  1.5 * 1920x1080


---------------
Collision Info
---------------
* For this game, I wanted to manually control all rotations and positioning.
* To bypass the built-in Physics simulation, set Rigidbody2D BodyType to Kinematic.
* When using Kinematic, in order to detect collisions, the object Colliders MUST be set to "Is Trigger".
* Note: As long as one of the colliding objects are set to IsTrigger, then the colliding objects can use OnTriggerEnter2D.


--------------
Sound Effects
--------------
* I often will implement a random selection between several clips when "firing" weapons.
* However, for this game I felt the variations in sounds was really annoying, so I found the shortest and least annoying sound effect and only used one.
* I also turned down the volume of the audio source when playing the shooting clip, as the player hears this sound almost constantly.
* I did the same with small enemy explosions.


--------------
Weapon Firing
--------------
* My first implementation of weapon firing had the player aim with the right stick and press and hold the right trigger to fire.
* While this works in a twin stick shooter type game like Nuclear Throne, in a hyper fast-paced game like Geometry Wars, right-stick fire feels better.
* Also, the ship no longer turns towards the stick aiming. It didn't look right for this game.
